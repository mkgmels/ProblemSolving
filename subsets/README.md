# Subsets Problem

The Subsets problem involves finding all possible subsets of a given set of elements. Given an integer array `nums` containing unique elements, the goal is to find all possible subsets (the power set) of the elements in `nums`. The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets, and the subsets can be returned in any order.

## Solution Approach

A common approach to solve the Subsets problem is to use backtracking. Backtracking is a general algorithmic technique that incrementally builds candidates for a solution, abandoning each partial candidate ("backtracks") as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution. By recursively exploring all possible combinations of elements, we can construct all subsets of the given set.

## Implementation

We have provided a Python implementation of the Subsets problem using backtracking. The function `subsets(nums)` takes an integer array `nums` as input and returns all possible subsets of the elements in `nums`. The subsets are represented as lists of integers.

## Usage

To use the provided implementation, simply call the `subsets(nums)` function with the desired integer array `nums`. The function will return a list of all possible subsets of the elements in `nums`.

Example usage:

```python
print(Solution().subsets([1, 2, 3]))
print(Solution().subsets([0]))
```

## Constraints

- \(1 \leq \text{nums.length} \leq 10\)
- \(-10 \leq \text{nums}[i] \leq 10\)
- All the numbers in `nums` are unique.
