# Problem: Valid Parentheses

Given a string `s` containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid. An input string is considered valid if:

- Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
- Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
- Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

### Examples:

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "()"
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "()[]{}"
Output: true
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "(]"
Output: false
```

### Constraints:
- 1 <= s.length <= 10^4
- s consists of parentheses only '()[]{}'.
