# Problem Description: Valid Anagram

**Problem Statement:**
Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `True` if `t` is an anagram of `s`, and `False` otherwise.

**Definition of Anagram:**
An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

**Examples:**
```
Example 1:
Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: True

Example 2:
Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
Output: False
```

**Constraints:**
- 1 <= s.length, t.length <= 5 * 10^4
- s and t consist of lowercase English letters.


**Solutions:**
