### Problem Description

Given an array of integers which may or may not contain duplicate elements. Your task is to remove duplicate elements if present.

### Example

#### Example 1:

Input:
```
N = 6
A[] = {1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 2}
```
Output: 
```
1 2 3 4
```

#### Example 2:

Input:
```
N = 4
A[] = {1, 2, 3, 4}
```
Output: 
```
1 2 3 4
```

### Your Task

You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function `removeDuplicate()` which takes the array `A[]` and its size `N` as inputs and returns an array with no duplicate elements present, in the same order as input.

### Constraints

- 1 <= N <= 10^5
- 1 <= A[i] <= 10^5
